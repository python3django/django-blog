    "body": "Django Reinhardt was a jazz guitarist who became one of the first important soloists in the genre.\r\nSynopsis\r\n\r\nBorn in Belgium on January 23, 1910, Django Reinhardt learned guitar at an early age, adapting his technique to accommodate the loss of the use of two fingers burned in a caravan fire in 1928. Reinhardt toured the United States with Duke Ellington in 1946. He was one of the first important guitar soloists in jazz; his blend of swing and the Roma musical tradition, as well as his unconventional technique, made him a unique and legendary figure. Reinhardt died in France in 1953.",

    "body": "What is Django?\r\n\r\nDjango (/\u02c8d\u0292\u00e6\u014b\u0261o\u028a/ jang-goh) is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python. A web framework is a set of components that helps you to develop websites faster and easier.\r\n\r\nWhen you're building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc.\r\n\r\nLuckily for you, other people long ago noticed that web developers face similar problems when building a new site, so they teamed up and created frameworks (Django being one of them) that give you ready-made components to use.\r\n\r\nFrameworks exist to save you from having to reinvent the wheel and to help alleviate some of the overhead when you\u2019re building a new site.\r\nWhy do you need a framework?\r\n\r\nTo understand what Django is actually for, we need to take a closer look at the servers. The first thing is that the server needs to know that you want it to serve you a web page.\r\n\r\nImagine a mailbox (port) which is monitored for incoming letters (requests). This is done by a web server. The web server reads the letter and then sends a response with a webpage. But when you want to send something, you need to have some content. And Django is something that helps you create the content.\r\nWhat happens when someone requests a website from your server?\r\n\r\nWhen a request comes to a web server, it's passed to Django which tries to figure out what is actually requested. It takes a web page address first and tries to figure out what to do. This part is done by Django's urlresolver (note that a website address is called a URL \u2013 Uniform Resource Locator \u2013 so the name urlresolver makes sense). It is not very smart \u2013 it takes a list of patterns and tries to match the URL. Django checks patterns from top to bottom and if something is matched, then Django passes the request to the associated function (which is called view).\r\n\r\nImagine a mail carrier with a letter. She is walking down the street and checks each house number against the one on the letter. If it matches, she puts the letter there. This is how the urlresolver works!\r\n\r\nIn the view function, all the interesting things are done: we can look at a database to look for some information. Maybe the user asked to change something in the data? Like a letter saying, \"Please change the description of my job.\" The view can check if you are allowed to do that, then update the job description for you and send back a message: \"Done!\" Then the view generates a response and Django can send it to the user's web browser.\r\n\r\nThe description above is a little bit simplified, but you don't need to know all the technical things yet. Having a general idea is enough.\r\n\r\nSo instead of diving too much into details, we will start creating something with Django and we will learn all the important parts along the way!",

    "body": "In technical terms, Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language with integrated dynamic semantics primarily for web and app development. It is extremely attractive in the field of Rapid Application Development because it offers dynamic typing and dynamic binding options. \r\n \r\nPython is relatively simple, so it's easy to learn since it requires a unique syntax that focuses on readability. Developers can read and translate Python code much easier than other languages. In turn, this reduces the cost of program maintenance and development because it allows teams to work collaboratively without significant language and experience barriers.\r\n \r\nAdditionally, Python supports the use of modules and packages, which means that programs can be designed in a modular style and code can be reused across a variety of projects. Once you've developed a module or package you need, it can be scaled for use in other projects, and it's easy to import or export these modules.\r\n \r\nOne of the most promising benefits of Python is that both the standard library and the interpreter are available free of charge, in both binary and source form. There is no exclusivity either, as Python and all the necessary tools are available on all major platforms. Therefore, it is an enticing option for developers who don't want to worry about paying high development costs.\r\n \r\nIf this description of Python over your head, don't worry. You'll understand it soon enough. What you need to take away from this section is that Python is a programming language used to develop software on the web and in app form, including mobile. It's relatively easy to learn, and the necessary tools are available to all free of charge.\r\n \r\nThat makes Python accessible to almost anyone. If you have the time to learn, you can create some amazing things with the language.",

    "body": "Biography\r\n\r\nThe Python programming language lies behind an enormous variety of software applications today, many of which affect our daily lives in ways both large and small. First released by its creator Guido van Rossum in 1991, Python has undergone continual improvement and has become a powerful yet flexible and easy-to- learn \u201cSwiss Army knife\u201d for programmers. Computer system administrators use it to solve daily problems quickly and developers can use it to build massive enterprise-scale websites. It is used in machine learning, banking, scientific computing, education, video games, math, physics, engineering, and for fast software prototyping by thousands of entities, including Autodesk, Google,Facebook, Microsoft, Dropbox, Alibaba, NASA, IBM, and hundreds of universities around the world. UC Berkeley and MIT are known to use it in their undergraduate programming courses.\r\n\r\nIn a 1999 report, Van Rossum highlighted the following as his goals for Python:\r\n\r\n    It should be an easy and intuitive language, just as powerful as major competitors.\r\n    It should be open source, so anyone can contribute to its development.\r\n    Its code should be understandable as plain English.\r\n    It should be suitable for everyday tasks, allowing for short development times. \r\n\r\nSince he made Python open source, Van Rossum has accepted the title of Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL) from the Python user community, for which he helps mediate disputes emerging from the language\u2019s ongoing development. Python is now more than a programming language: it is an advanced ecosystem, with dozens of sophisticated libraries and specialized commands tailored for dozens of diverse disciplines, from astrophysics to project management.\r\n\r\nSince graduating in 1982 with a master\u2019s degree in mathematics and computer science from the University of Amsterdam, Van Rossum has spent his life as a programmer, first in the Netherlands, then in the United States at NIST and CNRI, Google, and, since January 2013, at Dropbox. In 2006 the ACM recognized him as a Distinguished Engineer.",

    "body": "Of the numerous areas of global tension, arguably the most perilous is that between India and Pakistan. And recent events in Kashmir have made the situation even more dangerous. The reason is straightforward: India and Pakistan are in a long-running and incendiary dispute, they are both nuclear powers, and crossing a confrontational threshold could ignite a nuclear war between them. Indeed, arms control investigators have long identified the subcontinent as one of the world\u2019s likeliest nuclear flashpoints.\r\n\r\nIndia and Pakistan share a long and complicated history, and they have been in conflict over the disputed territory of Kashmir since 1947. The Himalayan region is one of the most militarised regions on Earth \u2013 former US president Bill Clinton has called Kashmir \u201cthe most dangerous place in the world\u201d.\r\n\r\nUnder the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act of 1947, Kashmir with its Muslim majority was free to accede to either India or Pakistan. But the local ruler, Hari Singh, decided against giving the population a choice, leaving the region in a geopolitical limbo and with a disputed border. A two-year war erupted between India and Pakistan in 1947 and another broke out in 1965. In 1999, the Kargil crisis, when the two countries again came to blows, may have been the closest the world has come to nuclear war since the end of World War II.\r\n\r\nDiplomatic interventions have previously helped to defuse the military tensions, but an enduring peace has remained elusive. Both sides have dug in along the disputed border and military skirmishes are commonplace.\r\nThe nuclear question\r\n\r\nIt has long been argued in international security circles that having nuclear weapons deters countries from using them in warfare. Indeed, in the post-World War II era, no state has used them \u2013 despite there still being around 15,000 nuclear weapons in the world. But horizontal nuclear proliferation has made the world a dangerous place; the more countries that have them, the more likely they are to be used at some stage.",

Five of these (the US, Russia, the UK, France and China) are members of the official owners club, who made their weapons early and had them legitimised in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) signed in 1968, the key piece of international law governing nuclear weapons possession.\r\n\r\nNPT has arguably been quite successful. In the 1960s it was widely anticipated that dozens of countries would get the bomb, as it appeared to be the fast track to clout and status on the world stage. But so far there have only been four rogue nuclear weapons states who ignored the NPT and made their own bombs. In order of acquisition, they are Israel, India, Pakistan and North Korea.",

    "body": "More countries have given up nuclear weapons programmes than have kept them, coming to believe they were more of a liability than an asset for national security.\r\n\r\nThe apartheid regime in South Africa secretly built six warheads, but dismantled the bombs and abandoned the whole programme in 1989 just before the system gave way to democracy.\r\n\r\nEven Sweden had an advanced and ambitious plan based on heavy water reactors to build up to a hundred warheads, but gave up the project in the 1960s, preferring to spend defence funds on fighter planes. \r\n The military juntas in both Argentina and Brazil pursued covert weapons programmes, although they stopped short of making a bomb, and the two countries gave up their programmes in the early nineties and joined the NPT.\r\n\r\nTaiwan and South Korea began developing plutonium production programmes in the late sixties and early seventies before the US persuaded them to halt in the mid-seventies and rely on Washington for security. Japan is generally considered to have a \u201cbomb in the basement\u201d, in that it has all the materials and know-how to build a warhead quickly if it decided to follow that path and leave the NPT. At present that course seems unlikely. \r\nThree successor countries to the Soviet Union \u2013 Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus \u2013 inherited nuclear weapons in 1991, and all three agreed to surrender them, in Ukraine\u2019s case in return for sovereignty guarantees from Russia that ultimately proved worthless.\r\n\r\nIn Iraq, Saddam Hussein dismantled his rudimentary nuclear weapons programme after the first Gulf war in 1991, and Libya\u2019s Muammar Gaddafi handed over his nuclear weapons beginner\u2019s set to the US in 2003.

    "body": "It is pretty difficult to make a nuclear weapon. If it was not we most likely would no longer be here. And it is difficult on two levels: making the fissile material and then constructing a device that will detonate it.\r\nAdvertisement\r\n\r\nMaterial is fissile when the nucleus of an atom can be split by a neutron that has broken free of another atom, producing large amounts of energy and more neutrons. When those free neutrons go on to split the nuclei of other atoms, there is a chain reaction, causing a nuclear explosion.\r\n\r\nUranium and plutonium are used for nuclear weapons, but only specific atomic configurations, or isotopes, of those elements are fissile. The fissile isotopes used in nuclear warheads are U-235 and Pu-239. The numbers refer to their atomic weights. The biggest single challenge in making a nuclear warhead is producing enough of these isotopes from the elements found in nature.\r\nFollowing the uranium path to the bomb requires converting refined uranium into a gas and then spinning it at very high speed in centrifuges to separate out the U-235, which makes up less than 1% of naturally occurring uranium. This has to be done repeatedly through \u201ccascades\u201d of centrifuges. Low-enriched uranium, used in civilian nuclear power, is usually 3%-4% U-235. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. Building enough centrifuges, and getting them to spin fast enough in unison, is the greatest technical challenge along the uranium route.\r\n\r\nPlutonium Pu-239 is produced in significant quantities by extracting it from irradiated uranium fuel that has been through a reactor. Because it is more fissile, less plutonium is required for a weapon. A sophisticated modern warhead requires as little as 2kg of plutonium, or at least three times that much uranium.\r\n\r\nOnce you have enough fissile material, you have to make it go bang. And to achieve that you have to force the atoms close enough together to trigger a chain reaction. There are two ways of doing this, and therefore two basic bomb designs.\r\n The most rudimentary is the gun-type warhead, which involves firing one chunk of fissile material into another at high speed with conventional explosives. The Little Boy bomb dropped on Hiroshima was a gun-type device using 64kg of highly enriched uranium (HEU).\r\n\r\nA more sophisticated bomb type, which requires less fissile material and allows the use of plutonium (which does not work in a gun-type warhead) is the implosion device, in which a sphere of HEU or plutonium is surrounded by explosives rigged to go off at exactly the same time to violently compress the core. The Fat Man bomb dropped on Nagasaki was an implosion device with about 6kg of plutonium.",
